Use to make the content scrollable in flutter

A problem arises when the content size is greater than the sizes of screen And we get a error over render

The solution for over render problem is to bind the container row column inside the single child scroll view widget  .

By default the direction for scrolling is vertical 

To make the scrolling direction horizontal we have to use scrollDirection: Axis.horizontal Inside the scroll child view widget
